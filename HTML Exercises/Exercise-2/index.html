            Only if you are living under a rock, you might not know about the arrival of eight cheetahs in 
            India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi released eight cheetahs that were brought from Namibia on
            his birthday on September 17 in their new home, Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh. 
            Actually, the wild cats were declared locally extinct in India in 1952. So, when a video of a cheetah 
            hanging out with a tortoise surfaced online, it obviously went viral.

            The now-viral video was shared by a page called Carsons Springs Wildlife on Instagram. It is a 
            not-for-profit animal park located in Gainesville, Florida. In the short clip, the cheetah can be 
            seen rubbing its head lovingly on the tortoise's shell.
